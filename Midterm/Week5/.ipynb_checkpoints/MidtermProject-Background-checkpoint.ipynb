    "This problem is important because climate change is a increasingly important topic in todays society. If more people try to realize this and take advantage of benefits provided by the government soon enough a majority of the cars bought will be electric. By exploring what age groups own EVs the most, the data can be used to target specifc audiences who may not be fully inclined to purchasing EVs as other age groups. Geographical location is also important so I will be comparing the EV usage in Delaware to the rest of the country. There are also many benefits to driving electric vehicles including reduced emissions, save costs for gas, and can improve public health and ecological damage.

    "One problem/ethical concern I may come across while analyzing the data is that I may not a large enough sample since electric vehicle adoption is fairly new and since the population of Delaware is fairly small compared to other states this might lead to inaccurate conclusions. Other than that for now I cannot think of many other concerns that I may have regarding this topic. As I analyze the data and topic further I will record the complications that I run into."
