    "## Before we get into coding, some questions that you should consider -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the visualization and what is it used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bar graphs display numerical quantities on one axis and categorical variables on the other, letting you see how many occurrences there are for the  different categories. Bar charts can be used for visualizing a time series, as well as just categorical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Can be used to compare categories of data \n",
    "    2. Can show large changes in data over time, in contrast to line graphs which often show smaller changes in data\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **What are some mistakes people make with the visualization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Scaling mistakes - y axis not starting a 0, \n",
    "    2. Using bar charts for highly connected data (should use line graphs instead)\n",
    "    3. Too many data points\n",
    "    4. Stacking rates, ratios, and averages\n",
    "\n",
    "    For more information go to: [Common Mistakes and General Rules for Making the Most of the Horizontal Bar Chart](https://charting-ahead.corsairs.network/what-not-to-bar-chart-a-visual-primer-cdb55a926d34)\n",
